                Magic mouse is a product that we wanted to develop in order to change the way we interact with out
                computers,
                instead of having to use a mouse we can use a webcam and our hands in order to direct where the mouse
                goes too,
                this allows us to move around the computer pointer without having to hold our mouse. Currently, it is
                far from perfect,
                in fact it would be in its very early stages, however we find the idea that we could use a webcam to
                control our mouse,
                and other devices as well quite fascinating. So using what we learned about Microsoft’s custom vision
                API from the microsoft workshop,
                and research we did on how to integrate our models into our code using python, we are able to present to
                you Magic Mouse.

            <h3 class="process">Process:</h3>

            <div class="explain">First we developed multiple models on custom vision in order to detect mainly the palm
                area of the
                hand,
                which later would allow us to get its coordinates and map it to control the mouse. To do so we collected
                our
                own data during the hackathon using our own python script that is able to collect thousands of images in
                a
                matter of a few minutes. Then, by hand selecting different images and marking where the hands were, we
                were
                able to create a few working iterations with decent accuracy in order to control the mouse.

                Secondly, we created a python script that connects to azure’s cognitive services and connected us to the
                iteration we wanted to use in order to predict the hand location. From there simply using the PyAutoGUI
                library we were able to move the mouse based on the hand’s position.

                Lastly, using an Arduino Uno and the PySerial Library, we tried adding a button for left and right
                clicks,
                which would often be controlled with the left mouse.
            </div>
            <h3 class="process">The Future:</h3>
            <div class="explain">
                In the future, Magic Mouse could certainly include other features that make it easier to control the
                mouse, such as the ability to detect certain hand gestures. It should also definitely have a way of
                keeping the control of the mouse precise, maybe focusing on one part of the hand would help with that.
                Lastly, working on optimizing the program to run faster is also another idea to focus on in order to
                improve the quality of the program.
